# Plan — governed agent memory (bank-grade, agent-speed)

Epic-level seed of the accepted 2026-08 plan. Every epic below requires
decomposition into ≤1-day tasks (by PR to this file) before any work is
claimable. Sequencing that is safety-relevant is marked ⚙ and must land as a
required check when the first dependent task is cut.

### E1 — Autonomy Envelope authority object

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** none · **Repo:** contextplane

One authority object: an ARC artifact of kind `policy` whose applicability
rules carry the delegated-authority matrix. Not `capability_contract` — that
kind means the contract a published capability offers its consumers, whereas an
envelope governs an agent principal's authority. If envelopes must be listable
as their own class, adding an `autonomy_envelope` kind is a CHECK-constraint
migration (`ck_arc_artifacts_kind`, 0001_baseline_schema.py) plus `ArtifactKind`
— a deliberate act, and cheap because no service logic branches on kind; a session ProvenanceGrant is a
runtime projection of it, never a peer object. Instant suspend (status flip,
push-invalidated, sub-second SLO), governed widen (full ARC pipeline).
Identities bind to IAM workload identities; stream-scoped action-class and
sensitivity declarations at source-namespace registration. Owned cold start:
initial template envelope approved by a named authority, posture
auto-accept-with-maximum-sampling.

### E2 — Hot observation write path

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E1 · **Repo:** contextplane

`POST /v1/sessions/{id}/observations`. Sync: auth/tenant via the visibility
chokepoint, envelope digest check, idempotency, closed-schema + provenance
completeness (`observed_time` and `external_record_id` caller-supplied where
the stream declares an external source), PII scan per tenant policy, cheap
synchronous embedding, one partitioned insert. All else async with per-tenant
fairness and lag stamps. Published p99 includes the PII-block mode.

### E3 — Resolve-as-receipt fused retrieval

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E2, E9 ⚙ · **Repo:** contextplane

Extend `/v1/context/resolve` (no fourth surface): three concurrent
visibility-predicated candidate generators, RRF merge, batched hydration.
Receipt write splits into a synchronous, durably committed receipt-intent row
(chained, receipt-loss RPO zero) plus async hydration of arms, items and
exclusions. The intent row MUST carry a completeness discriminator —
`hydration_state` (`pending` | `complete` | `failed`) plus the item and
exclusion counts known at write time — because `context_receipts` today has
only the envelope `state` column, so an un-hydrated receipt would otherwise
read as complete with zero exclusions, which the receipts module calls worse
than no receipt. `GET /v1/receipts/{receipt_id}`, `/exclusions` and
`/references` surface that state and never present a `pending` receipt as
evidence. Derivative registration (`register_receipt_links`) stays inside the
synchronous transaction — an unregistered derivative is reached by no erasure
and swept by no expiry. Hydration lag and failure alert against an SLO, and the
shipped fail-closed guarantee in `contextplane/context/resolve.py` may only be
relaxed once the discriminator exists in schema and read models.
Trust/quarantine state in the vector index key; adversarial-selectivity
benchmark gates.

### E4 — Provenance-scoped quarantine + DORA wiring

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E2 · **Repo:** contextplane

Quarantine by provenance predicate with dry-run blast-radius preview; bulk
bitemporal revert; pre-quarantine of downstream receipts; severity
classification mapped to DORA materiality thresholds; classification-as-major
starts a tracked regulatory notification clock — initial, intermediate and
final report windows stamped as distinct deadlines on the auto-created incident
case, with at-risk escalation and deadline state visible to the operator — and
evidence-bundle export scoped to that case. Quarantine is wired to both halves:
the classification and the clock.

### E5 — Review-budget allocator + reviewer cockpit

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E3, E9 ⚙ · **Repo:** contextplane, contextplane-ui

One governed SamplingPolicy per (tenant, action class, sensitivity tier) with
acceptance-sampling math; expected-loss + leverage ranked queue with
consequence preview; `disposition_actor` (human | policy-automated) first
class; non-self-starving trust decay (frozen materiality at decay time; decay
is a trust-class transition, not supersession). Cockpit UI is the first-class
disposition surface.

### E9 — Model governance of allocator components ⚙

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** none · **Repo:** contextplane

Ranker and tier function (E5), sampling designs (E5), and retrieval fusion
weights (E3) registered and independently validated BEFORE any score-consuming
feature activates. Score-consuming means an epic that computes ranked, fused,
tiered or sampled output — currently E3 and E5; epics that only render
already-governed scores (E10, E11) are out of scope. Encoded
as a required check: guarded paths flag-off until a committed
validation-evidence artifact exists and passes schema check.

### E6 — Tamper-evident spine + records management

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E2 · **Repo:** contextplane

Externally anchored tamper-evidence (bounded exposure window — never called
non-repudiation); retention classes; schedule-driven disposal via
crypto-shredding recorded as auditable deletion events; PII block tier for
undeclared streams.

### E7 — MCP surface contract + two-call memory loop

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E1, E2 · **Repo:** contextplane

One machine-readable tool registry: default connection exposes ~6–8
envelope-derived core verbs; full surface opt-in per envelope; registry↔OpenAPI
parity gate and registry↔docs conformance gate. Two-call remember/recall with
safe defaults routing through the PII-scanned hot tier; time-to-first-memory
quickstart.

### E8 — Memory-quality eval harness

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** none · **Repo:** contextplane

Ground-truth labeled sets; extraction precision/recall per predicate;
retrieval relevance judged against receipts; multi-session recall; wired as a
release gate and published as buyer-facing evidence. Absorbs the speed
benchmark suite.

### E10 — UI/IA workstream

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E5 (screens), none (bug fixes) · **Repo:** contextplane, contextplane-ui

Ordered: cockpit dispositions + quarantine/suspend screens → nav/DESIGN.md
repositioning + ARC/PII operations out of the raw console → canon copy.
Immediate bug fixes independent of the rest. In contextplane-ui: replace the
nonexistent `traverse_dependencies` with the real `get_dependencies` and drop
the false "usage data" attribution in
`apps/admin-dashboard/src/features/getting-started/GettingStartedDialog.tsx`;
remove "semantic data mesh" from the UI scope statement (`README.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`). In contextplane: fix the stale `cd registry` clone directory in
`README.md` and `docs/02-get-started/01-quickstart.md` — it is in this repo,
not the UI repo.

### E11 — Consumption legibility (suppression-compliant)

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E3 · **Repo:** contextplane, contextplane-ui

Receipts explorer over existing endpoints; tenant-scope served-claims
aggregates under the existing suppression floors; audit-role drill-down with
recorded justification. Never per-actor cells outside the audit role.

### E12 — Migration/import path

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E1, E5 ⚙ · **Repo:** contextplane

Bulk-import API with provenance mapping; Backstage/CMDB/wiki connectors.
Provenance mapping reuses the governed assertion path — `observed_time` and
`external_record_id` map from the source record and are never server-defaulted,
and no importer-local validation runs in parallel. The batch-attested
"migrated-canonical" disposition records `disposition_actor = policy-automated`
from E5, never by widening `approval_authority`, and its sampled audit draws
from E5's single governed SamplingPolicy, inheriting that policy's
below-minimum-sample halt rather than defining a second sampling regime.

### E13 — Surface consolidation and deprecation

**Kind:** epic · **Status:** pending · **Blocked by:** E2, E3, E7 · **Repo:** contextplane

Simplicity is subtraction, not just profiling. Once the two-call
remember/recall loop (E7) is the served default: consolidate the five
observational write verbs (assert_claim, record_session_event,
add_workspace_entry, append_intent_checkpoint, ingest_signal) behind the hot
write path where their semantics overlap; deprecate redundant per-surface
variants with a dual-alias window; retire MCP tools that the registry shows
unused after the default profile ships; collapse read paths that fused resolve
subsumes. Tracked metrics: default-profile tool count (target ≤ 8), REST
endpoints an agent integration must know (target ≤ 6), and deprecated-surface
count trending to zero. Rule: no consolidation may drop a governance property
(provenance completeness, receipts, envelope gating) — surfaces shrink, the
control set does not.
